## Simple .htaccess for Clean URLs and Custom Error Pages

This .htaccess file provides a straightforward way to rewrite URLs and redirect to custom error pages. Be sure to read the README for a full explanation of how it works.

Key Points:
Remove file extensions: To make this rewrite work, you need to remove all file extensions (e.g., .php) in your HTML. This includes every href and header('Location: ...').

Avoid using the R flag: If you add the R (redirect) flag in your rewrite rules, it will change the URL in the browser, which can cause issues with POST and GET requests. In my solution, I chose to remove the R flag and opted for a simpler approach thatâ€™s beginner-friendly.

As a relatively new developer, I found this setup challenging, and I would have appreciated finding a solution like this online. Hopefully, this will help others who are in the same situation.
